# Roo Implementation Comparison

## 1. Default Roo Behavior
- More forgiving with command execution
- Less strict mode boundaries
- Flexible tool usage across modes
- Minimal context requirements
- Auto-approves many operations

## 2. RooFlow's Structured Approach
- Strict mode separation
- Clear handoff patterns
- Memory Bank integration required
- Explicit tool permissions per mode
- Requires proper context initialization

### Key Differences in Tool Usage
```yaml
Default Roo:
- execute_command: Available in all modes
- file_operations: Flexible across modes
- context_switching: Automatic and fluid

RooFlow:
- execute_command: Restricted by mode
- file_operations: Mode-specific permissions
- context_switching: Explicit handoff required
```

## 3. Mode-Specific Behaviors

### Architect Mode
- Default Roo: General purpose design and planning
- RooFlow: Strict focus on system design, documentation, Memory Bank management

### Code Mode
- Default Roo: All development tasks
- RooFlow: Specific to implementation, requires proper context

### Test Mode
- Default Roo: Testing and validation
- RooFlow: Requires explicit handoff from Code mode

### Debug Mode
- Default Roo: General troubleshooting
- RooFlow: Specific error investigation workflow

### Ask Mode
- Default Roo: General questions
- RooFlow: Documentation and knowledge sharing focus

## 4. Working with RooFlow Structure

### Proper Mode Usage
1. Start in Architect mode for new features
2. Use explicit mode switches
3. Follow handoff patterns
4. Maintain Memory Bank context

### Tool Usage Guidelines
1. Check current mode permissions
2. Use appropriate handoff triggers
3. Maintain proper context
4. Follow mode-specific patterns

## 5. Common Issues

### Tool Execution Problems
- Incorrect mode for operation
- Missing Memory Bank context
- Improper handoff patterns
- Placeholder values in system prompts

### Solutions
1. Verify current mode
2. Check Memory Bank status
3. Use proper mode switching
4. Update system information

## 6. Best Practices

### For Default Roo
- Use natural workflow
- Less focus on mode switching
- Direct tool usage
- Flexible approach

### For RooFlow
- Follow strict mode patterns
- Maintain Memory Bank
- Use proper handoffs
- Document context changes

## 7. Recommendations for Projects

### When to Use Default Roo
- Smaller projects
- Single developer
- Flexible requirements
- Quick iterations

### When to Use RooFlow
- Larger projects
- Team collaboration
- Strict requirements
- Need for persistent context

## 8. Converting Between Approaches

### From Default to RooFlow
1. Initialize Memory Bank
2. Set up mode structure
3. Update system prompts
4. Implement handoff patterns

### From RooFlow to Default
1. Simplify mode structure
2. Remove strict handoffs
3. Update tool permissions
4. Adjust system prompts
