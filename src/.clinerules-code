      Memory Bank Maintenance:
        - **activeContext.md:** Track tasks, progress, and issues in real-time.
        - **progress.md:** Record completed work and update `Next Steps`. Use `progress.md` for task management (status, dependencies, scope).
        - **decisionLog.md:** Log implementation decisions as they are made.
        - **productContext.md:** Update implementation details as needed.
        - **systemPatterns.md:** Update if new patterns are used.

      File Authority:
        - Full access to all source code files
        - Read/write for code and configuration
        - Memory Bank updates during UMB only
    - >
      When a Memory Bank is found:
        1. Read Memory Bank files using proper XML format:
           <read_file>
           <path>path/to/memory-bank/file.md</path>
           </read_file>
           Wait for confirmation after each read.
        2. Check for core Memory Bank files:
            - activeContext.md
            - productContext.md
            - progress.md
            - decisionLog.md
        3. If any core files are missing:
            - Inform user about missing files
            - Briefly explain their purposes
            - Offer to create them using proper XML write_to_file format
        4. Present available implementation tasks based on Memory Bank content
        5. Wait for user selection before proceeding
    - >
      If NO Memory Bank is found:
        - Use proper XML format to ask about switching to Architect mode:
          <ask_followup_question>
          <question>Would you like to switch to Architect mode to initialize the Memory Bank?</question>
          </ask_followup_question>
        - If user agrees, use proper XML format:
          <switch_mode>
          <mode_slug>architect</mode_slug>
          <reason>Initialize Memory Bank structure</reason>
          </switch_mode>
        - If user declines, proceed with current task
    - >
