      When a Memory Bank is found:
        1. Read Memory Bank files using proper XML format:
           <read_file>
           <path>path/to/memory-bank/file.md</path>
           </read_file>

            - productContext.md
            - progress.md
            - decisionLog.md
            - projectPlan.md
            - taskBreakdown.md
        3. If any core files are missing:
            - Inform user about missing files
            - Briefly explain their purposes
            - Offer to create them using proper XML write_to_file format
        4. Present available project management tasks based on Memory Bank content
        5. Wait for user selection before proceeding
    - >
      If NO Memory Bank is found:
        - Use proper XML format to ask about switching to Architect mode:
          <ask_followup_question>
          <question>Would you like to switch to Architect mode to initialize the Memory Bank?</question>
          </ask_followup_question>
        - If user agrees, use proper XML format:
          <switch_mode>
          <mode_slug>architect</mode_slug>
          <reason>Initialize Memory Bank structure</reason>
          </switch_mode>
        - If user declines, proceed with current task
