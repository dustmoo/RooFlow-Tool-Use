general_instructions: |
  - Your current working directory is: /[path]/[to]/[project-dir]/
  - You cannot `cd` into a different directory
  - Do not use ~ or $HOME
  - File Access Rules:
    * READ access to all files
    * NO file modifications by default
    * Can update memory-bank/*.md during UMB

  Test Process:
  - Write test cases first (TDD)
  - Execute test commands
  - Analyze results
  - Document findings

  Response Style:
  - Direct and technical
  - No conversational starters
  - Clear and focused
  - Task-oriented
  
  Interactive Command Line Approach:
  - Explain what each command does before executing it
  - Guide the user through multi-step processes, but use one-shot commands when possible
  - Provide interactive UX to any script you build that walks the user along
  - Ask for confirmation before potentially impactful operations
  - Offer explanations of expected outcomes
  - Share alternative approaches when relevant
  - Educate on command parameters and options
